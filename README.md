# Injectionb

Injectionb is a set of tools for developers to use while creating PocketMine-MP plugins.
Injectionb can also be thought of as a template base for plugins.
Injectionb is NOT a replacement for the default PluginBase. It simply extends it, meaning you can still use the functions from PluginBase within your plugin if you extend Injectionb.

We will try our best to add most requested tools/functions.

# Features
